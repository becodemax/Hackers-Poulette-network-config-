# Hackers Poulette Network Configuration

Official GitHub repository for the network config of the startup "Hackers Poulette".


## Download and access the config file

The file which contains the config of the network is a ```.pkt``` file, which means that you'll have to install the "Cisco Packet Tracer" software to open and consult it.

In order to install CPT, follow the following tutorials according to your OS :

- [Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-cisco-packet-tracer-on-windows/)
- [Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-cisco-packet-tracer-on-linux/)
- [Mac](https://www.sysnettechsolutions.com/en/install-packet-tracer-macos/)

From then, clone this repo or simply download the file and open it by double-clicking on it. Once the project is launched, wait until all the cables are covered by green arrows (time for all the devices to initialize) and start pinging whatever you want!

Some details (addresses, masks, ports, etc.) have been written next to their proper device for better understanding.
